YaboJsCss  is a simple combination of 2 systems allowing to combine, pack and compress javascripts and CSS files


USAGE:
edit combine.php and .htaccess to define the directory where your files are stored 
place combine.php and .htaccess at the root of your website, add the lib directory with the class.JavaScriptPacker.php

ISSUES:
- be carefull to combine correctly the .htaccess, if you are using a CMS he is most likely using one, place the redirects right after "RewriteEngine On"
- the packer can break some jQuery code, when files start with "(function($) {"   in that case, add a semicolumn before => ";(function($) {"
- sometimes it just won't work, so either keep the original "combine" (just comment line 58 of comment.php) or move the problematc file in another directory that /js/ and include as you would normally do

ABOUT COMMENT FRAMEWORK
you don't need to compress jquery, prototype, mootols... they can be loaded directly from google

All I did was adding the php Packer to the project to mignify and obfuscate the javascripts, should you need such feature.
the CSS are not mignified, only GZ compressed
